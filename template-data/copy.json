{"title":"THE LONG HISTORY OF COURT ORDERED SCHOOL DESEGREGATION","date":"<Enter Date Here>","description1":"The year is 1955. The Supreme Court has unanimously been decided that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\"","description2":"All states are ordered to desegregate public schools \"with all deliberate speed\".","intro":"Fast-forward to 60 years later and many public schools across the nation have still yet to comply with court orders to desegregate.","hedStep1":"The first court-ordered desegregation of schools followed after the Brown decision in 1955. Most court-ordered desegregation of schools, X (%), following the decision were in Southern states like Arkansas, Alabama, and Mississippi. The most infamous instance of resistance occurred at Little Rock Central High School where the “Little Rock Nine” were prevented from entering the previously all-white high school by the  Arkansas National Guard who had been deployed by order of the Arkansas State Governor. The standoff was only resolved after President Eisenhower’s direct intervention.","hedStep2":"By the 1960’s we saw an increase of X% in the number of school districts with a court order.","step2":"The 1960’s was the height of the civil rights movement, which was marked by a surge in grassroots activism in all sectors of African-American life including education. In 1968 the Supreme Court ordered every state to desegregate their school systems. In order to comply with law, under the mandate of Brown, the schools were judged on desegregation using 5 factors: facilities, staff, faculty, extracurricular activities, and transportation. To this day, these factors are still used to evaluate whether a school can legally be considered desegregated.","hedStep3":"Flash forward to the present day…","step3":"As of 2018 there have been X number of total mandates to desegregate made in the 60+ years since the first Brown decision.","hedStep4":"X% are still active, with at least X number dating back to 19XX.","leadin1":"Court-ordered desegregation of schools don’t happen without reason. When a state’s Department of Education receives numerous complaints from parents, teachers, and superintendents about failed desegregation in a school, the bureau launches an investigation into whether the school is complying with the 5 desegregation factors mandated by Brown. In some cases, schools have received multiple court orders since the 1950s because of de facto re-segregation occurring, leading to increased complaints.","step1_1":"Up to 2006 the number of complaints per year remained under 10.","step2_1":"After 2006, however, we see a large spike in the number of complaints up until 2012 where approximately 65 complaints are made per year.","leadin2":"There are a variety of reasons why complaints spiked after 2006. Several historical events and trends have played particularly important roles in increasing community awareness around school desegregation.","hedReason1":"2002 -","reason1":"In 2002 “No Child Left Behind” was enacted. The policy stated that all school districts must bring every student up to a “proficient” level as judged by state-issued standardized tests given annually in grades 3-8 and once in high school.","hedReason2":"- 2006","reason2":"By 2006 most schools should have updated their policies and curriculum to adapt to NCLB. In the same year, social networks Facebook and Twitter are released to the public. Social media quickly becomes a popular platform for all Americans to voice their concerns locally and nationally.","hedReason3":"2007 -","reason3":"In 2007 the Supreme Court finds “voluntary school integration plans unconstitutional”  in Parents Involved, paving the way for contemporary school segregation to escalate.”","hedReason4":"- 2008","reason4":"In 2008 the Great Recession hits the United States. As thousands of families lost their main sources of income, parents became increasingly conscious of the need for a quality education that can withstand economic downturns and secure strong financial futures for their children. Parents became increasingly involved with their children’s education. One path many parents saw to improving their children’s education was through desegregation.","hedReason5":"2013 - 2014 -","reason5":"As stated in “No Child Left Behind”, every school district had to educate all of their students up to at least a “proficient” level by state standards in both math and reading by the 2013 and 2014 school year. This is likely why we see a spike the year prior, and a slight dip there after, once the pressure to bring all students up to some standardized measure of success has subsided.","conclusion":"Cite Raj Chetty research."}
